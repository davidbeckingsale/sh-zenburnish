This is a SyntaxHighlighter configuration file using the Zenburn colour scheme.
The aim of this config is to be used with the ZenSandbox wordpress theme found
at http://github.com/davidbeckingsale/ZenSandbox

Credit to mnem for all the original work, please see his repository at
http://github.com/mnem/sh-zenburnish

To use the theme, move it to somewhere accessible from your server,
and use a link with the following format on the page where you want to
use the theme:

<link type="text/css" rel="Stylesheet" href="/path/to/theme"

* The original README is included below:

This SyntaxHighlighter configuration file approximates a zenburn colour 
scheme when embedding code in Wordpress blogs.

Zenburn is an excellent colour theme that's really rather popular amongst
vimheads.
